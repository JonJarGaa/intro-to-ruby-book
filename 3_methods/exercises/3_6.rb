What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'



MY ANSWER: 
The method "calculate_product" requires 2 arguments to run instead of 1 given

SOLUTION:
You are calling a method called calculate_product that requires two arguments, 
but you are only providing one.
