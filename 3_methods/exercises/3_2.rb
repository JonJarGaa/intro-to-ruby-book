4. four = "four"

5. print something = "nothing"


=begin

MY ANSWERS: 

1 => 2 (Variable declared = return value of declaration/assignment)
2 => nil (puts will always return nil)
3 => "Joe" (p will return what is puts'ed)
4 => "four" (variable declared = returne the value of declaration/ass.)
5 => nil (print will return nil

SOLUTIONS: 

1. x = 2    # => 2
2. puts x = 2    # => nil
3. p name = "Joe"    # => "Joe"
4. four = "four"    # => "four"
5. print something = "nothing"    # => nil
